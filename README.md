# EcoEats

## Overview
EcoEats is a nonprofit web application designed to connect restaurants with surplus food to local charities in need. Our mission is to reduce food waste and help those in need by facilitating food donations efficiently.

## Purpose
The app aims to bridge the gap between privileged restaurants that have excess food and underprivileged charities that require food assistance. By creating a seamless connection, EcoEats helps promote sustainability and combats food insecurity in the community.

## Features
- **Restaurant and Charity Forms**: Users can fill out forms to provide general information, available food items (for restaurants), and food needs (for charities).
- **Geolocation Matching**: Uses Google Maps API to match nearby restaurants with local charities for efficient food pickups.
- **Impact Metrics**: Provides reports to restaurants on the amount of food donated and the meals provided to the community.
- **Personalized Pairing Plans**: Once matched, a detailed plan for food transfer is developed, ensuring a smooth process.

## How It Works
1. **Registration**: Restaurants and charities fill out a quick form with their details.
2. **Matching Algorithm**: The app uses a geolocation-based algorithm to pair restaurants with nearby charities.
3. **Personalized Plans**: Once paired, a personalized plan is created outlining how and when the food transfer will take place.
4. **Notifications**: Both parties receive notifications for updates, pickups, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js (if applicable)
- **Database**: MongoDB (if applicable)
- **APIs**: Google Maps API, Web Notifications API
